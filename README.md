# Online_Donation_App 

This is a Flutter-based Online Donation App where users can donate to different social causes such as education, healthcare, disaster relief, animal welfare, and more.


The app provides a smooth and secure way for users to register, log in, make donations, and keep track of their past donations. I have integrated Firebase as the backend for storing user and donation data.
